Your second point however is vastly misinformed. Many cancers can surely be attributed to direct environmental impacts such as smoking etc. But genetics and age play a huge role in cancer susceptibility and development. Some people will get cancer regardless of environment, some will just be more predisposed to getting it, and the older you get the higher your chance of getting cancer due to faulty cellular replication.

Fact: when this process is repeated over millions of generations and millions (or billions) of years under an immeasurable number of changing variables, it leads to divergence and speciation.

We still can't produce a living cell from what we think earth had in natural ways. There is still no proof that couple of cells living together can form new life forms who produces offspring with multiple cells or complex organisms such as animals or humans.

 I feel like if we implement a system of checks and balances and make punishments harsher and public, things would go a lot better, not amazingly but better than they are. 

I actually dont remember the last shooting that happened here. Not sure if you guys see more news about that or not, the last shooting I remember is the one in New Zealand and the other one in Holland. (Obviously just in general, not in country)

Edit: Looked at wikipedia for a quick idea of gun related violence. What is being defined as mass shootings is 4 or more people injured.

704,h4kya64,t1_h4js8n9,"I’m going to put a little cherry on top of @nuttynutdude statement.

Those 5-15 years cited in your two articles assume you are coming in cold to a brand new type of disease. COVID-19 is the “disease” but the virus itself is a similar strain virus as SARS (its even in the identification name SARS-COV-2), so any and all early research in development of similar vaccines against SARS virus from the past are applicable in development. That’s a major lift for specifically COVID as it has familial virus strains that have been studied. Then some of the new vaccine technology for MRNA wasn’t invented over night, that was done over years previously and just had a well timed moment in the sun for application to COVID.

The bureaucracy mentioned is another factor that takes forever.

Also, generally, products go through Phases 1-3 of clinical testing. After each phase is a new study methodology had to be developed, which is usually a lot of arguing and negation of nuance for what primary, secondary and tertiary endpoints they want to test for.

Phase 1 - small group- healthy individuals; tests for safety (primarily)
Phase 2 - slightly bigger group; tests for drug/vaccine efficacy (primarily)
Phase 3 - bigger pivotal study; larger sample size, additional demographics, etc. phase 3 is generally the basis for approval. 

So now let talk about safety-

As mentioned above, safety, in all regards is literally the very first thing that is tested. Well before how effective drugs/vaccines are.

Also, historically, most ALL vaccines ever made ever, will show any negative side effects within the first two months. Which is a short window to monitor. This is because anything in the vaccine leaves your body fairly quickly. It works by training your own immune system to be able to adapt, attack and neutralize the viral infection. So long term risk with any vaccine is extremely rare.

I’ve worked in pharmaceuticals for 12 years on a number of drug/vaccine launches so can tell you most of the hold up comes from approval and review processes as well.

I can answer this one. [Unvaccinated people don't only risk their own health: Their bodies become 'variant factories'](https://www.businessinsider.com/unvaccinated-people-are-variant-factories-disease-expert-says-2021-7)

When unvaccinated people like you cause variants, it makes the vaccines we got less effective.  For example, [the Pfizer vaccine is 94% effective against the original but 64% effective against the delta variant](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-is-less-effective-against-delta-variant-israeli-data-show-11625572796)

No. Alpha came from the UK late last year when hardly anyone was vaccinated. Delta came out of India where hardly anyone is vaccinated.  Gamma came from Brazil in January when no one was vaccinated.  

I don't know if you made that lie up, or if someone intentionally misled you and lied to you and you believed them, but it's not true.  All of the variants we have now started from unvaccinated populations.

>This is very common knowledge, the few bits of covid that survive become dominant, because they are the ones that can survive to reproduction.

Except that, currently, vaccinated people by-and-large aren't getting and spreading any of the variants, either.  They're spread en-masse by unvaccinated people.

The virus needs to be able to reproduce to cause mutations, and it needs to spread for that mutation to take.  Vaccines stop that reproduction and stop the spreading of the virus.

I think you're confusing this with what happens with bacteria and antibiotics. Like when you half-ass an antibiotic regimen and end it early.  The only ones left were the strong ones, and those are the ones that reproduce.  That's not how antibodies work.  They prevent the reproduction from the get-go so it doesn't even get to that point.

Honestly, it's simple:  The more infections, the more possibilities of mutations.",t3_ogl9sa

Then why did you even ask?  I was only trying to tell you why vaccinated people want non-vaccinated people to get vaccinated.  You're essentially telling me you had no intention of ""giving any ground"" on that?  I'm almost afraid to even ask what you think the reason is.

And for this:

>I wash my hands regularly, and use hand sanitizer when not near a sink. So... How can someone become a 'Variant Factory' without anything to variate?

Because while that can reduce the chance of infection, vaccines reduce it to almost nothing. Washing your hands and wearing a mask is good, but it's not 95% effective like vaccines are.",t3_ogl9sa

When it comes to the human mind we have a common thinking process of cause and effect. Typically when we see an effect we do everything in our power to find a cause. So when we have people being diagnosed with all of these diseases with unknown causes (and no cures) of course we are going to look for a cause. The scientists go looking for actual reasons because they have had the education and are intellectually driven to find a real cause for these disease. During the meantime some people found a faulty blog and is simplified enough for them to understand and to then fit their cause and effect mind set. Not to mention this is the only 'probable' cause (vaccines) for these diseases, meaning it's the only cause that has surfaced and spread so widely. 
Basically, it's easy to blame something when you have a thing to blame. It's easy to blame unknown causes on something everybody gets (vaccines). I'm pretty sure if you wanted to try and convince then that water caused these issues, you probably could because of their gullibility.

None of my kids were vaxxed until a few years ago. IMO my kids' pediatrician and our CPS worker were AMAZING and turned me around completely. My kids know I used to be antivax too, and I use it to remind them that being wrong feels like being right the entire time you're doing the wrong thing - get outside input and ask yourself what harm *actually* happens if you take a different path? 

Long story short, I was in a very abusive dynamic and my (now ex) husband convinced me that vaxxing was a bad idea, for a multitude of reasons. In reality, he just didn't want their pediatrician to keep tabs on them/me and figure out about the abuse. It happened so gradually that looking back I still can't figure out how I kept moving my own red flags like that, but he was just that good at grooming everyone.

Fast forward to when he got caught abusing our daughters, and the CPS worker was amazeballs about the whole vax thing (no, my kids were never taken away, I left the bastard & he's in prison). I remember she had several gentle conversations about it with me, asked my concerns, helped me sort through fact vs fiction that my ex had snuck into my thinking, and encouraged me to talk to their pediatrician for actual medical advice. He was equally as empathetic and supportive, helped me get the kids caught up, and they're all on track now (and have been for several years now).

If any of them had shamed me or ridiculed me, I'd have never reconsidered. Treating me like a person, answering my questions, reassuring me etc was totally the way to go. I talk to a lot of antivax parents now, and some of them have similar family dynamics.

Getting vaccinated or getting your child vaccinated is not pleasant.  Lots of people have needle phobias, and I suspect it’s not fun even if you don’t have a needle phobia.

Vaccination has been so successful against some diseases that a lot of people don’t know of anybody who had a bad case of one of those diseases.

Fear of autism. Because disabled people are mainstreamed more now than they were many years ago, because people are more willing to talk about disabilities now, and because we’ve learned that milder forms of autism exist, many people do know of somebody who is autistic. The same goes for some other things that antivaxxers like to blame on vaccines, like autoimmune diseases.

Andrew Wakefield and his fraudulent study linking vaccines and autism.

We don’t have a simple alternative narrative about what causes autism or autoimmune diseases. We can’t point to a virus or a lifestyle habit or a gene that causes them. And we don’t know of a way to prevent them. The antivax movement offers a simple explanation and a way to prevent the problem. Of course that’s more appealing than telling people it just happens sometimes, and we don’t know any way to prevent it.

There’s an idea that it’s better to avoid foods where there are long, unfamiliar, and scary sounding ingredients on the ingredients list. It’s easy to generalize that idea into avoiding scary chemicals in general. Vaccines have scary sounding chemicals in them.

I think a lot of these people feel alienated or intimidated by how outside of their own comprehension and control so much of the world is, so they fall back on conspiracy theories to make themselves feel validated and in control again. Like, some parents can't come to terms with the idea that their child's developmental disorder came from the random cruelty of genetic chance, so they instead construct a narrative where it's all a scheme by a cabal of evil doctors, because an actual villain with an agenda is far more comforting than the truth that we're all powerless in the face of random chance.

I think social media and the desire for belonging and validation is a big part of why certain conspiracy theories have blown up so much in the last few years. I think it has less to do with the actual conspiracy theory as it does feeling like a part of a community that praises you and tells you that you're smart and correct and special for agreeing with them, plus the feeling of superiority that comes with believing that everyone else is a misguided sheep.

Andrew's friends had just designed a new MMR vaccine.  
But there was already an MMR vaccine that was just as good, so theirs wouldn't instantly dominate the market.  
Andrew's friends paid him stupid amounts of money to discredit the existing MMR vaccine as being dangerous.  
Andrew decided that Thimerosol, a preservative in the existing vaccine that his friends weren't using, could be isolated as the ""dangerous element"".  
Andrew conducted a series of studies that involved essentially torturing children with strange diets and multiple unnecessary shots.  
Andrew then literally bullshitted at least half of his data, because the children he was stabbing didn't support his narrative.  
Andrew's test children ""developed autism"" as a result of the Thimerosol.  
Andrew submitted his ""findings"" for peer-review...  
...but Andrew's peers couldn't duplicate his results.  
Andrew's ""study"" was thrown out, Andrew himself was discredited.  
Conspiracy nuts (as they do) assumed this meant that Andrew had found some Secret Truth that Big Science didn't want us to know.  
From there, the idea began to mutate.  
Big Science was BAD. It was BAD because it put AUTISM and a DEADLY POISON, into shots for CHILDREN.  
So the ingredient Thimerosol was removed from many vaccines.  
This didn't matter, because it was too technical for the Conspiracy Nuts to comprehend. Big Science was still BAD. It was BAD because it put AUTISM and DEADLY POISON, BAD THINGS, into CHILDREN.  
But there was no more ""deadly poison"" in the vaccines.  
There had to still be BAD THINGS in the vaccines, though!  
  
And this is why it's claimed that vaccines contain over a dozen deadly/stupid/immoral ingredients, up to and including ""blended aborted baby matter"".  
It doesn't matter if it's true. It only matters that the claims are horrifying.",t3_bx57hf

Most people have this illogical connection that vaccines cause autism.  So they are anti-vax based on this stupid nonsense.  

Then there are certain groups who view the totality of human life - i.e. the including the life between death and rebirth, and view disease as part of the karmic processes needed to purify one's self to attain to a state called Atman.  So vaccinating against that prevents spiritual development.  

Humanity itself is not ready for the whole life process stuff so we are not really ""anti vaxers"" I vaccinated my son, but I did so recognizing that I would be taking on his karmic debt associated with any illness he should have received.  

In fact, any parent with the foregoing understanding, should know you are taking on the karmic debt so you shouldn't worry about harming your children.

There is a war that exists between the black lodges and white lodges - and there will come a time when the black lodges attempt to ""vaccinate against the soul"" - through a vaccine attempt to cut off any desire to engage in any spiritual study.

I wouldn't want the government telling me I HAVE to get these shots, I think it crosses a line.  But I also think they should put more effort into educating the public on how they actually work.  

I do think the anti-vaccination movement is one of the stupidest things to come about, and I always try and educate people on why they are being an idiot, I just don't think having the federal government mandate it is a good way of going about it, other than making it difficult for people to participate in society without it.

Imagine in a dystopian society some mind control juice, or poison to control overpopulation was injected into people by law. Maybe he watches too much scifi. I haven't had any vaccines, also I'm terrified of needles, but I've been alright. 

I have a question for you guys, why do unvaccinated people pose a threat to vaccinated people if you are already immune to whatever disease we are susceptible to? Why can't we live with free choice, and if someone dies because they weren't vaccinated, well, that's kind of their fault, oh well?",t3_chl0qi

I am not talking about that. They literally only recommend that researchers and military get the anthrax and smallpox vaccines, and with rabies, they then extend that to people who are in extended contact with animals. That is it.

Compare the number of deaths/sickness from none vaccinations to the number of cases of consequences being suffered from being vaccinated.

Every year, nearly 11 million children die before reaching their fifth birthday, most from preventable causes. That is approximately, 30,000 children per day.

This is a worldwide figure. Meaning these are coming from places that either choose to not vaccinated, or don't have access to vaccinations. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates active immunization currently averts 2 to 3 million deaths every year.

SO DAMN MANY people are vaccinated today, but yet these dumbfucks are convinced they make everyone autistic and drop dead. Around 86% percent of the population is vaccinated, and every one of them is more healthy then your god damn infected slobber goblin Karen.

 If you live your whole life, never having a vaccine, and you lived a full and healthy life, then you made a good decision.

If you do choose to vaccinate and live a long healthy life, again, you made a good decision. If you do vaccinate, and you suffer a bad reaction, or even life threatening reaction, or die, then you made a bad decision.

There is an ecological theory called herd immunity. The idea is that if the majority of the group is immune then the disease can not establish and infect those that are immunodeficient or cannot get vaccines. We sort of act as a wall to protect our fellow humans. People who don’t vaccinate allow an opening for disease to establish.

I would even go as far as to say that it's more dangerous, because it's easy to show that extremists are extremists, but it's much harder to show that the more moderate people using the same arguments based on the same pseudoscience as anti-vaxxers are just as wrong.  This allows those false arguments to fester unchallenged and ultimately to continue to confuse someone learning about vaccines for the first time who might see conflicting information and believe there is a controversy when there is no actual controversy among experts.

Your mother believes they push vaccines ""very early.""  What is ""early?""  How early is too early?  Did your mother reach this conclusion by doing an academically trained literature review of published material (not simply a review of google search results) or via expertise in a relevant field?  Or is the underlying implication the baseless anti-vax claim that vaccines are unsafe for babies?  Is she skeptical about the timeline due to real-world epidemiological data, or is the implication simply that vaccines are unsafe and more vaccines are more unsafe?  Her complaint is that her claims seem legitimate, but the counterpoint is that they are not in any way legitimate: they are based off an unscientific claim made by one doctor who offered an alternate vaccine schedule with no evidence behind it, while the CDC's vaccine schedule is based on mountains of evidence and they caution that delaying vaccines may lead to vaccination gaps in the population that is most susceptible to vaccine-preventable illnesses.

I realize that it's a bit counterproductive arguing against your mom through you, but I think it was worth posting in case anyone else is considering this version of anti-vax or happens to associate with people who believe this.  These alternate vaccine schedules are a false middle ground that makes it seem like responsible vaccination is as extreme as anti-vaccination, when in reality both the middle-ground and the anti-vax extreme are equally anti-scientific.",t3_dub0pg

If you would research the other side of the issue though, I think you'd see that a real case, with real testimony and real evidence can be made for saying that forcing certain vaccines on on all people, even if you're putting them at risk is exactly what you're saying  you're opposed to, but for yourself.

I understand that your own self interest can outway the interests of a stranger (I mean this realistically and sincerely, not as a shot against you) but also understand that the interest of the person not wanting to vaccinate is based on wanting to protect your health, or the health of a child.

On the one hand you want to be protected potentially at the expense of another (though you don't believe that) and on the other hand the other person also wants to protect themselves (potentially at your expense as you see it). 

This is the debate, are certain vaccines dangerous for certain people at certain extremely young ages? Until that debate can be answered honestly and without disinformation, active deception and whistle blower testimony from within the structure that makes and approves the vaccines themselves, then there will be, and should be debate.

The debate isn't about trying to harm you or not, no one wants to harm you. The debate is based on the validity of the studies and those who provide the info and publish the studies.

As long as those issues exist, to force people to undergo potentially medically dangerous procedures against their will is Un-American.

People are, and should remain free to disagree. 

Their are highly educated people on both sides of this issue, if that's the case then maybe there are valid reasons on both sides as well.

I know in this day and age though the agree to disagree philosophy is dying. The left and right sides of the sociopolitical front has become highly polarized in this age of social media. It's as if the right thinks the left is genuinely evil, and the left thinks the right is genuinely evil. I'm sure I wouldn't be remiss to say both sides believe the other side is horribly misguided, uninformed, actively and willfully ignorant of the facts and worse.

I think the truth is more along these lines: most people want to do what is, generally speaking, the right thing. They want to be good people, parents and citizens. 

It's ok to disagree on how to do this, in fact its healthy to, and to debate the ideas and opinions surrounding the facts. Where everyone needs to take a step back is making the individual one with the idea. If you're going to disagree with an idea with a constructive outcome being the goal, disagree with the idea itself, not with the person's value as a human being.

1446,enhxnqk,t1_enhf92w,"I get that. I'm definitely not advocating putting people in danger. I'm not advocating not getting vaccinated either. I suppose my concern is whenever an issue presents where freedom is weighed on the scales with safety, freedom seems to lose out. Giving the government or the states the power to compel citizens to do something, when there is legitimate evidence that said thing could be dangerous seems to me to be a slippery slope.

There are members of the CDC who have come out and been whistle blowers about improper procedure and concealed test results when it comes to vaccines. The industry even strong armed Congress into protecting them from lawsuits, effectively absolving them of responsibility if anything went wrong.

These instances call into question the studies performed and the evidence supplied. 

For instance, the studies show that vaccines are overwhelming positive (of which I agree) however, evidence and testimony from within these programs suggests manipulation of the facts from the very people who supply the data for these studies.

This alone is enough to call into question what the truth is and if the general public has heard it.

Some batches of vaccines are bad, just like some batches of food are bad and have gotten us sick. The answer is improved safety regulations there.   Vaccines are proven to work.  Just look at what its done - polio for one is almost gone. That's not a coincidence, its purely by vaccination because there isn't a cure for it.


ugh.  Internet.  Just... look up legitimate studies. At least 3 of them.  Double blind placebo ones if you want the gold standard.  

But ultimately when you have a medical issue, we tell you to go to your doctor. Doctors overwhelmingly vote for vaccines.",t3_boji38
1449,enivxwj,t1_enikjhi,"Agreed. It does seem to be the people who research a topic is the exception and not the rule.

Full disclosure, I'm vaccinated, my kids are vaccinated, even my cat is vaccinated. 

I do have an autistic son. There is a correlation between when he recieved certain vaccinations and when his autism manifested.

We had other children after him, and despite the correlation still chose to vaccinate, but on a different schedule, we delayed certain vaccines based on age. All the indicators were that a short delay did no harm (kids still vaccinated before school age) and the delay (possibly) helped.

Not to downplay doctors or their knowledge, not at all, but I've  been in health care most of my adult life, I'm middled aged so we're not talking a few years either. I've worked in one of the most elite healthcare centers in the U.S. and I could provide you with a myriad of instances where doctors have done scary, irresponsible and downright stupid things and have cost patients their lives, and just shrugged it off.

I'll grant that behavior was not the norm, but I can tell you that just because doctors say something, doesn't make it gospel.

That said, they would, under typical circumstances, be trustworthy. I also don't believe for a second the ones advocating for vaccines are being irresponsible. 

As you said, vaccines have done a lot of good, I'd say on balance it's pretty obvious they've done much more good than harm.

My point of contention is that, whatever studies are done, and I have tried hard to expose myself to as many as possible, there are still questions left unanswered and even actively ignored by the CDC. There are clear instances of deceit surrounding this issue, and that from within their own ranks.

The institutions that control these meds, and the source material used has been tainted by this. Essentially they've broken trust.

I'm sure you can relate, that in our personal lives, broken trust is very hard to repair.

Can you appreciate, in light of what I've said, how some parents are honestly worried about the life, health and well being of their children? They would be bad parents if they weren't worried. (I mean that generally speaking, I'm not saying you're a bad parent if you're not worried about vaccines.)

The answer to this problem is regaining the broken trust through a concerted effort to reach out to the people who are legitimately and not unreasonably afraid. 

A legal action to enforce vaccination on people who are unwilling is a mistake. As I said before, in a socialist country I'd expect this behavior, but in the U.S. it's just not how we do things.

Freedom is messy, and hard, and takes constant effort and vigilance to maintain. It requires dialogue, debate, the ability to allow for liberty that you yourself (or any of us) might not agree with. To shed those values, even in the name of safety is not the American way.

I don't mean this offensively at all, so please don't take it that way when I say, America is a unique outlier on this earth, this country holds certain values and precepts that no other nation on earth holds to the same degree. If this nation's core values are not shared  by you, (or anyone living here for that matter) or if you feel like mass enforcement of medical treatment should be pushed on the people without their consent, then there are plenty of places you can go in the world that share that sentiment, but not the United States of America. 

We aren't known as the land of the free and the home of the brave for nothing. It's a well earned and well deserved title, at least as far as the founder's values were concerned. Sadly our leaders have let us down so often in the last 50 or so years that I understand how that view of the country has been shaken, but the principles the U.S. was founded on are still there, and we need to defend those principles if the U.S. is going to remain a place the rest of the world can look to for help and guidance. 

This country has its problems to be sure, some pretty big ones, but it's still the best game in town.

It's like that whole thing with Alex Jones, personally I think he's kind of an ass and I don't watch his content, however I don't think it's right for multiple corporations to get together and decide to take him off the internet.

Debunking them does. Only way to have that is to have open conversations, which requires freedom of expression.

I used to read my news on FB a lot. I liked a centralized location where I could access the same topic from several opposing news agencies and compare the facts they share and try to decide what I think happened. After the mass ban of alternative news sites, I stopped going there and unfollowed/unliked every page I had ever clicked before I left.

We already know these massive corporations are working together to ban speech they deem harmful. That's why Facebook, Google, and Twitter  need to be made public utilities. Google has become so large it swallows up any competition. This is all uncharted territory here. So when you have these tech giants targeting one group of people they do have the power to scrub them off the internet. It's not a coincidence patreon, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube suddenly took all of Alex Jones content away. That was 100% a coordinated attack. Alex Jones could make his own version of YouTube or his own website but what happens when Google fucks with the algorithm so no one even sees it? He could design his own version of PayPal to get funding but what happens when mastercard decides he can't use their service? You're right, they are not the ENTIRE internet, but when you can no longer use any of these platforms you're basically going to be sitting in a dark room yelling into the void. These places are now the modern equivalent to the town square, where everyone goes to get their news and have their voices heard, so there needs to be oversight to make sure they are not imposing their personal beliefs on the rest of us.

1545,egixof2,t1_egiwezy," The vast majority of unvaccinated kids will live full healthy lives.

You're not wrong but the reason for that is called herd immunity where a large enough portion of the population being protected from a disease helps prevent transmission of the disease to those that aren't vaccinated for whatever reason...

Now with that said I would like you to consider this... let's say this anti vaccination trend builds and theres more and more unvaccinated people which decreases herd immunity and the result of this is an increased number of cases of people being affected by preventable diseases. That's the problem with the anti vaccination moment. 

In my opinion someone should have all the right in the world to make a dumb choice when they're the only one that suffers the consequences of said choice... choosing not the get a child vaccinated is a choice where the consequences affects the health of other people...

I personally believe that there should be legal consequences for parents whose unvaccinated  children are found to be patient zero of an outbreak...like an assault charge, or if the person dies, a negligent homicide charge.  If people start getting charged with murder, we won’t need to censor the idea because we are creating consequences for the choice. ",t3_aqvw2d

She initially believed all the craziness connected to autism, but she's a very intelligent woman who went on to do her research and decided while the autism link was problematic at best, there were still issues surrounding vaccination that bothered her. I believe as she believed that there's a lot of hype and moral panicking that go along with vaccinations, and that everything should be approached with thorough research. For 'newer' vaccinations that were being very heavily pushed she would try to find as much information on how long they had been tested/researched and exactly why they were being pushed for (think the cervical cancer/hpv jab). 

I am aware that my lack of vaccination was dangerous, but I would disagree with those avidly pro-vaccination fanatics (there are extremists on both sides) that feel that my mum was some awful human being that intentionally put her children and other children at risk. I was very lucky growing up, because my mum had the time to really look after me when I became ill; I never had the MMR shot or the one for chicken pox, and my mum actively sought the illnesses out and then really monitored and looked after me while I had them. It wasn't really a 'risk' because she knew what to do/what to watch for.

Seeking out the illness is equivalent to stepping in to the ring on a random day to fight the opponent without training.

In either scenario, you will learn how the opponent fights, but with the vaccine, you are better prepared and less likely to end up in the hospital. With any training, there is a risk of injury (side effects), but it is more controlled and less damaging to your body.",t3_2dmhk6

CT folks were usually pretty bright.  Often times they had amazing imaginations and while they might champion one thing they held more true than others they were more aficionados of it.  You could chat with them and if you didn't agree it was fine, they never took it as a personal affront.  Those that did or got violent were often shunned by the community.

The current crop of Hoaxers hang onto these things with a personal bent, often times because it allows them to not have to come to grips with more difficult things to grasp.  They're easy answers for those unable to comprehend that for some things we don't have answers (anti-vaxxers) or that the answers defy some long held belief (9-11 happened because we're disliked by foreigners).

Some of the dumbest people I have ever met are Hoaxers.  People who lack the ability to reason or think creatively or even recall why they believe something is the way it is or back up their statements have been Hoaxers.

Guys like Alex Jones weaponized it, turned it into an identity and ideology and exploited it for profit and agenda.

But after the war, Winston Churchhill and Harry truman (among many others) began a campaign of preventing the spread of communism, which they perceived as a threat to them and their way of life. Keep in mind both were very wealthy men. This is in large part what started the cold war. The US and its allies had to be militarily and culturally dominant over the world, to prevent communist revolutions. The US and its allies formed NATO to do this. NATO restricted a lot of trade to the USSR and actively worked to undermine their development, which angered the Russians and caused a lot of tension. 

Fast forward a few decades, the USSR collapses, and now russia is a power vacuum that eventually gets filled by Putin, who himself worked for the communist government. He essentially wants to re establish the dominance of the east, against the west. So to do this, they meddle in campaigns to weaken NATO members and also do a bunch of other stuff like cyber attacks.

1624,h14nysu,t3_nvq3r6,"Anti-vaxers are much the same as any other conspiracy theory; a general mistrust of authority figures and a cultural trend towards more faith in 'folksy' and 'common sense' knowledge than legitimate education and understanding. 



People like to feel empowered. And it's empowering to feel like you've got some kind of ""inside track"" or access to hidden knowledge that isn't mainstream among society at large. And people often like to feel like they're individually heroic; battling against some kind of insidious, power enemy whose motivates are not well defined.


Conspiracy theories are most at home in America which, perhaps more so than any other culture, has a general mistrust for the very *concept* of government and a very ingrained sense of individualism and romanticizing a kind of wild-west self reliance, but many conspiracy theories have started to bleed into other cultures (the UK and Australia, for example, have a small but growing population of SovCit archetypes. Many of whom use the exact same arguments that American SovCits do, even though they're under a completely different legal system and none of those arguments, even if they were correct, would be applicable).



Anti-vaxers are a little more dangerous than some other conspiracy theories though because it contains a fear element. So while it might take a particular kind of credulous idiot who believe that the earth is flat, for example, otherwise normal people might be persuaded towards vaccine paranoia out of fear for themselves of their families. And it doesn't help that, like all conspiracy theories, it's loaded with enough desperate facts that (absent any of the surrounding context and/or data that refutes their interpretation of said facts) that someone who isn't inclined to dig beyond the surface level can be taken in by them.


Conspiracy theories work because of lazy thinking. And because, thanks to social media, people tend to get all their information in bite-size today and seem to accept at face value the first thing they read. Such that even if they read better sourced information later that directly disproves that meme they read they other day, they'll tend to side with the one they read initially.

I think I have a fun perspective because 10 years ago when I had my first child I was not exactly ""anti vax"" but I was very hesitant to allow somebody to inject my child with something I suddenly realized I had very little knowledge on. I didn't trust the government, or pharma, and this is before it became a big fuckin deal to sit and think for yourself about major choices like this. 

I waited until my kids were 8 to vaccinate because I wanted to be able to tell if something went wrong. One of them was totally fine. The other one developed a severe motor tick that will likely never go away. She isn't mentally retarded but she looks like she is. She can't help her twitching and I am certain it was from the hepatitis B vaccination. Onset of symptoms began 2 hours after injection and worsened over a period of 48 hours. 

I am not pro nor anti vaccination. I am glad my kids are protected against some illnesses but I also feel extremely guilty for telling my child that she would be perfectly ok by having this shot, and then, she wasn't. 

People talk about this without any experience. None of them have had adverse reactions and on Reddit it is likely many of them don't even have sex much less children. The reason they don't have any words to back their pro-vax nature is because they don't actually know why they're doing it other than following a trend. Believing everything they hear. Just like they say about anti-vax people, who are likely holding onto their beliefs through stories like the one I just shared with you about my permanently changed child, their distrust in gvmt and business, and not having seen these diseases around to be properly scared of what they can do. 


Anybody who is an extremist about this is doing it wrong. Compassion is the only way we can understand and trust each other. Nobody is going to decide to be pro or anti by way of bullying so...

If pro vaccination ppl want to really ""help"" they need to stop shoving it down throats and bullying. Maybe understanding the hesitation and knowing how to educate would do a lot more for the obvious common goal which is getting people vaccinated. 

But you're right. All they know how to do is say ""no it doesn't cause this or that"" but have no real ways of explaining why it doesn't. Just, that it doesn't. Which makes any critical thinker say hmmmm, yeah you're dumb and I'm obviously right here.

I declare that the key to understanding the potentially bad science of big pharma is in the choice of control groups in publicly presented studies. 

To understand this one must define things a little. A ""vaccine shot"" contains a ""vaccine"" and ""delivery component"". It is important that one appreciates a vaccine shot and vaccine as separate things, as with the delivery component. That delivery component is what contains the highly contested toxic metals, aborted stem cells and fetus tissues or other non human tissue etc. The vaccine is typically the actual illness being attempted to be prevented, in some form. So, when a safety study is presented, the control group (being pinned against the vaccine shot) is always either another ""vaccine shot"" or simply the ""delivery component"" on its own. 

Following that logic alone should make one pause. I urge anyone interested in this issue of ""real science"" to look at the studies themselves and consider the methodology carefully. I am almost completely sold on this being the primary crutch of the argument that ""Vaccine shots"" are safe and effective, and so that should worry anyone. 

I imagine the natural rebuttal regarding the seeming lack of available control groups is due to the idea that subjecting a group to non vaccination is unethical. That however is beyond the scope of simply trying to tackle whether or not good science is being conducted and if we are being told the truth by the media. It is a circular argument that cant really help us figure this out. I would simply extend it as a comment about why the companies, and government might not be using truly scientific methodology containing true control groups. , It could be the trump card for not doing better science with a non vaccinated control groups.

If you follow the logic, and read the studies yourself you would surely have something to say in response other than the only thing that got you to consider that the topic is more complex was an n=1 case of a reaction and not the argument raised. 

If you are interested in reactions, then you must investigate the federally run Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which clocks in the 100s of thousands of reactions, from mild to deadly and is the main bases of over 6 billion in USD in awards to families so far.

When I fill out a death certificate for one of my patients, I’m required to fill out the immediate, intermediate, and long-term causes of death along with every condition that may have contributed to death. If there’s any question, an autopsy can be performed to narrow down the likely cause(s) of death. 

We also don’t get paid for any diagnoses listed on the death certificate. We get paid for the admitting diagnosis. If they are admitted for COVID-19 and then die of something completely unrelated, we get paid exactly the same as if they die of COVID-19 because the hospital visit was for COVID-19. Likewise, I get paid for what I diagnose in my office visits, not for what might happen when you leave the office. There is zero incentive for me to lie on a death certificate as I do not get paid anything at all for filling them out or for what I write on it. 

Whomever you’re getting your information from has no idea how medical billing works and has never filled out a death certificate before in their life.",t3_l00ide

But now they are trapped inside a bubble and the longer they stay inside that bubble the harder it will be to escape it. Sure there are facts that obviously prove them wrong but to accept them it would require them to give up their safe, predictable world view.

1918,ecex0pr,t3_a8y84m,"So, I'm not an anti-vaxxer, but I've spoken to a few of them over the years, and they have a few concerns that might even be legitimate. 

For one, the reuse of needles used to be endemic (not in the U.S.) and might have done more harm than good. Its bizarre to me that the nurses learned germ theory, and understood it, but did it anyways. The scientific literature behind not reusing needles is very strong, and not really up for debate.

Another issue is that when you do anything a few million times, there are going to be some people with adverse reactions. The military for example requires anthrax immunizations, and one soldier experienced temporary paralysis from it. Now, a couple people having strong negative reactions do not outweigh the benefit of immunizations but its never a good idea to deny that these reactions occur. Being defensive in this is not a good idea, and it breeds mistrust.

The other issue they bring up is the use of inert mercury in synthesis of immunizations. But these same people don't realize its also used in dental fillings, so if were a problem, it would be a big one, and I do not believe that millions of people with fillings are dying of mercury poisoning so it can't be that big of a deal.",t3_a8y84m
1919,eceylhn,t3_a8y84m,"The federal government has paid out $4B to vaccine victims over the past 3ish decades.  1:1M doses result in compensable harm.  Hundreds of millions get paid out to vaccine victims each year.

They created a special ""no-fault"" court system and fund to remove any liability from the pharmaceutical companies.  This system is designed not to say vaccines were at fault, but pay out the victims anyways.

I do not believe a market where a government can practically mandate demand, remove price signals via insurance dictates, and indemnify suppliers from any liability is one that is free from risk or corruption.

So, I don't want to intentionally introduce my children to risk of harm to protect against something that has a roughly equivalent amount of risk with random chance.

What I find so utterly confusing is how the same people who loathe Big Pharma, demands everyone be their customers.

It's so bizarre.",t3_a8y84m
